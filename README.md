# Secundo-v-1.0

Overview:

Secundo is an Optical Music Recognition (OMR) project that converts images of sheet music into MusicXML, a universal format for digital score editors. The goal is to allow users to upload either printed or handwritten scores and receive a valid MusicXML file that can be opened in notation software like MuseScore or Finale. This removes the need for manual transcription, enabling composers to share and edit their work more efficiently.

The project is built in Python using PyTorch for machine learning components and standard image processing libraries.
