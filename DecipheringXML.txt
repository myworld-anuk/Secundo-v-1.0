The <!DOCTYPE score-partwise ...>
This is the Document Type Declaration (DTD); it tells any program that opens the file:
“This XML document must follow the rules defined in the score-partwise DTD from MusicXML.”
Defines which elements are allowed, their order, and attributes

<score-partwise version="4.0">
n XML, there must be exactly one top-level element that encloses everything else
Mine is this line in the example WholeNote file

<work><work-title>Untitled score</work-title></work>
Contains the title shown at the top of the page

<identification> ... </identification>
Who/what made the file, and when (e.g., MuseScore 4.5.2, date). The many <supports.../>

<defaults> ... </defaults>
Page size, margins, staff line widths, and fonts; these affect engraving (how it looks), 
not the musical meaning

<credit...> ... </credit>
Positioned text for title/subtitle on page 1 
Engraving coordinates like default-x/default-y place the words visually

<part-list> 
sets up what instruments exist, how they’re labeled in the score, and how they 
should sound in playback

<part id="P1">
This is where the actual notes and rests are defined

<attributes>
